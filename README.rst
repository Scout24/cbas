About
=====

This is the command line interface to the
`*c-bastion* jump host <https://github.com/ImmobilienScout24/c-bastion>`_.
It allows you to upload an ssh-key-file and create a user on the jump-host, so
that you can log into it. It requires an initial connection to auth-server to
obtain an (open-id-connect) access token.

The basic flow is as follows::

    +-----------------+  +-----------------+  +-----------------+
    |                 |  |                 |  |                 |
    |    developer    |  |    jump host    |  |   auth server   |
    |                 |  |                 |  |                 |
    +--------+--------+  +--------+--------+  +--------+--------+
             |                    |                    |
             +----------------------------------------->
             | request token      |                    |
             <-----------------------------------------+
             | receive token      |                    |
             |                    |                    |
             +-------------------->                    |
             | upload key         +-------------------->
             |                    | validate token     |
             |                    <--------------------+
             <--------------------+                    |
             | upload OK          |                    |
             |                    |                    |
             +-------------------->                    |
             | ssh log in         |                    |
             |                    |                    |
             |                    |                    |
             |                    |                    |
             +                    +                    +

Where ``developer`` is your local machine (desktop, laptop, etc..) ``auth
server`` is the auth-server and ``jump host`` is the jump host. ``cbas`` takes
care of obtaining the token and uploading the ssh-key.

Install
=======

Use the Python standards, for example:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install cbas

Quickstart
==========

#. Install the software.

#. Ask one of your colleagues for the ``auth-host``, ``client-secret`` and
   ``jump-host`` parameters.

#. Then run the following to upload your key:

   .. code-block:: console

       $ cbas -a <AUTH-host> -s <CLIENT-SECRET> -h <JUMP-HOST> upload
       ...

#. Then you *should* be able to login, using:

   .. code-block:: console

       $ ssh <JUMP-HOST>
       ...


Usage
=====

.. code-block:: console

    $ cbas --help
    Usage: cbas [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

    Options:
      -v, --verbose                   Activate verbose mode.
      -c, --config <config_path>      Path to config file. Default: '~/.cbas'.
      -u, --username <username>       Username. Default: the logged in user.
      -k, --ssh-key-file <key-file>   SSH Identity to use. Default:
                                      '~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub'.
      -p, --password-provider <provider>
                                      Password provider. Default: 'prompt'.
      -s, --client-secret <secret>    Special client secret, ask mum.
      -a, --auth-host <host>          Auth-server host.
      -h, --jump-host <host>          Jump host to connect with.
      --version                       Print version and exit.
      --help                          Show this message and exit.

    Commands:
      delete  Delete user.
      dry_run Dry run, sanitize all config only.
      upload  Upload ssh-key and create user.

Options
-------

verbose
  This switch activates verbose output, useful in case you are debugging

config
  The path to the config file. Note, since we are using the
  `yamlreader <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/yamlreader>`_ package, this could
  also be a directory with multiple config files. Also, the config is in YAML
  syntax, see below.

username
  The username when communicating with the auth-server. Note that the
  returned token contains the authenticated username which is subsequently
  sent to the jump-host. Thus you will not be able to create arbitrary users
  on the jump-host

ssh-key-file
  Path to the *public* ssh-key-file. This will be uploaded to the jump-host.

password-provider
  Where to get the password from. Valid values are ``prompt`` and ``keyring``
  (and ``testing``). ``prompt`` will always ask for a password, whereas
  ``keyring`` will ask exactly once and then store the password in the system
  keyring.

auth-host
  The hostname of the auth-server. E.g ``auth-server.example``. (Note that, by
  default this will use ``https://`` as scheme and ``/oauth/token`` as
  endpoint. However, explict urls, e.g.  ``http://auth-server.example`` and
  explicit endpoints e.g. ``auth-server.example/special/id/auth`` are
  tolerated.)

client-secret
  A special client secret string needed when communicating with the
  auth-server.

jump-host
  The hostname of the jump-host. E.g. ``jump-host.example``. (Note that, by
  default this will use ``https://``. However, explict urls, e.g.
  ``http://jump-host.example`` are tolerated.)

version
  Display version number and exit.

help
  Display help and exit.

Subcommands
-----------

upload
  Upload ssh-key-file and create user.

dry_run
  Sanitize and aggregate all options from config-file and command-line. Don't
  connect to anything.

delete
  Delete your user again. For example: if you uploaded the wrong ssh-key-file.

Config-File
===========

``cbas`` is equipped with a powerful configuration mechanism. All relevant
parameters that can be supplied on the command-line can also be supplied in the
config-file, for example:


.. code-block:: yaml

    username: acid_burn
    ssh-key-file: ~/.ssh/mykey_rsa.pub
    auth-host auth-server.example
    client-secret: mysupersecret
    password-provider: keyring
    jump-host: jump-host.example

Please note that, any parameters supplied on the command line will take
precedence over those supplied via the config-file. If in doubt, try using the
``--verbose`` switch.
